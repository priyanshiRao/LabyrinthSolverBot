## README

This repository consists of different labyrinth mazes and ways to solve them. 

Initially, it is Arduino microcontroller based C++ repository but can be extended to different MCUs.

Maze consist of lines (paths) distinguishable from the background of maze on which the bot moves and completes the maze without external help.

It works using the infrared sensors and on the principle that different colours reflects different intensity of light.
